# Mainline program logic
def main():

    # Prompt user for individual monthly costs
    monthly_loan = float(input('Enter the monthly loan amount: ')) # Monthly loan payment
    monthly_insurance = float(input('Enter the monthly insurance amount: ')) # Monthly insurance premium
    monthly_gas = float(input('Enter the monthly gas amount: ')) # Monthly fuel cost
    monthly_oil = float(input('Enter the monthly oil amount: ')) # Monthly oil cost
    monthly_tires = float(input('Enter the monthly tires amount: ')) # Monthly tire care cost
    monthly_maintenance = float(input('Enter the monthly maintenence amount: ')) # Monthly maintenance cost

    # Call the show_expenses function and pass the monthly costs to it
    show_expenses(monthly_loan, monthly_insurance, monthly_gas, monthly_oil, monthly_tires, monthly_maintenance)

# Define the show_expenses function
# Calculates monthly and yearly auto costs
def show_expenses(loan, ins, gas, oil, tires, maint):

    # Calculate the monthly total of auto costs and displays the monthly and yearly costs
    monthly_total = loan + ins + gas + oil + tires + maint # Sums all of the monthly costs
    print(f'Total monthly expense: ${monthly_total:.2f}') # Displays the total monthly cost
    print(f'Total annual expense: ${monthly_total * 12:.2f}') # Calculates and displays the cost per year.

# Call the main function to execute the program.
